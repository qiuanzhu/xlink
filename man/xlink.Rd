\title{xlink: A package for genetic association models for X-chromosome SNPS on continuous, binary and survival outcomes.}
\description{
The expression of X-chromosome undergoes three possible biological processes: X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), 
escape of the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI-E),and skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI-S). 
To analyze the X-linked genetic association for phentype such as coninuous, binary, and timeto-event outcomeswith 
the actual process unknown, we propose a unified approach of maximizing the likelihood or partial likelihood over 
all of the potential biological processes.
