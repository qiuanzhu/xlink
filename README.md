Genetic association models for X-chromosome SNPS on continuous, binary and survival outcomes
Abstract
The expression of X-chromosome undergoes three possible biological processes: Xchromosome
inactivation (XCI), escape of the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI-E),
and skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI-S). Although these expressions are
included in various predesigned genetic variation chip platforms, the X-chromosome
has generally been excluded from the majority of genome-wide association studies
analyses; this is most likely due to the lack of a standardized method in handling
X-chromosomal genotype data. To analyze the X-linked genetic association for timeto-
event outcomes with the actual process unknown, we propose a unified approach
of maximizing the partial likelihood over all of the potential biological processes. The
proposed method can be used to infer the true biological process and derive unbiased
estimates of the genetic association parameters. A partial likelihood ratio test statistic
that has been proved asymptotically chi-square distributed can be used to assess the
X-chromosome genetic association. Furthermore, if the X-chromosome expression
pertains to the XCI-S process, we can infer the correct skewed direction and magnitude
of inactivation, which can elucidate significant findings regarding the genetic
mechanism. A population-level model and a more general subject-level model have
been developed to model the XCI-S process. Finite sample performance of this novel
method is examined via extensive simulation studies.An application is illustratedwith
implementation of the method on a cancer genetic study with survival outcome.
