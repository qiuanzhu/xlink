Description: The expression of X-chromosome undergoes three possible biological processes: X-chromosome
             inactivation (XCI), escape of the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI-E),and skewed X-chromosome                    
             inactivation (XCI-S). To analyze the X-linked genetic association for phentype such as                         
             coninuous, binary, and timeto-event outcomeswith the actual process unknown, we propose a unified              
             approach of maximizing the likelihood or partial likelihood over all of the potential biological             
             processes.
